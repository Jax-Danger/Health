# FiveM Health Script
This is a simple Health script for FiveM written in TypeScript. Feel free to use this how you wish. Edit this as much as you want. You can even use this as a base to write scripts in TypeScript for FiveM.

# Installation
Right off the bat, the first thing that is needed when installing the script, is running the command **npm I**. This will install the packages needed for the script. Next run **npm run build** to begin using the script. If you make changes to the script, run **npm run watch** to auto-build changes or **npm run build** to build changes just once. After running either command, restart script and you are good to go.

Please reference the following video for information on how the script was made: https://youtu.be/XFaH47NHTZc?si=yQz3XwHnWy7sjQtt
